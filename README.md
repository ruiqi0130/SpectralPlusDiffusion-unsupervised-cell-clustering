# SpectralPlusDiffusion-unsupervised-cell-clustering

This is a course project for MATH322 at Yale.

A novel pipeline use spectral clustering and diffusion distances to dissect cluster-structure of single cell RNA-seq in high-resolution level.

This pipeline is consist of two parts: 1. Spectral clustering using graph laplacain; 2. k-medoids clustering using diffusion embedding.
